# FlyingTaxiProductManagement
Flyber is a flying taxi service developed for New York. This repo contains the initial proposal, data infrastructure and product management

In this project, the 3 main sections explored are:

1. Developing a launch strategy for Flyber in New York, using ground taxi data. In this, KPIs are defined based on data exploration which would justify this product as well as define the success criteria
2. Developing a scalable data strategy which can capture the necessary relevant data as well as having the capability to incorporate new features
3. After the product has been launched, it needs to be maintained and scaled. This is explored in the iterative product management step. Here we explore sustaining KPIs, funnel analysis, feature addition with A/B testing and qualitative and quantitative feedback analysis.

The summary of this project is presented in "Summary_PPT.pdf"
